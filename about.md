  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    I’m Tianyue Yang, a Master’s student at the University of Cambridge. I work on generative modeling for AI4Science, especially applications in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and quantum chemistry (wavefunction theory). I’m also interested in physics-inspired generative algorithms and in building theory to better explain how AI models behave. I’m always open to collaborations, feel free to reach out ♪
